#Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is a social networking book review site. That is build off the sample application from [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org) 
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com)
I am deeply indebted to mr. Hartl for the back end that runs this program and for his beautiful tutorial which has taught me everything I know about ruby and rails.
Things I have added/hope to add.

Branding for U 31. Book review modules. A working Admin assignment process. A mobile version for smart phone users. Password reset function. Private messaging. Search for users. Search for Books. Search for Authors. Hopefully  much more.

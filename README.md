#University 31: a safe Haven for Christian Women to encourage and help each other.

This is a social networking site specifically for Christian women to discuss how to be better wives/mothers and christian women in general.
I am deeply indebted to [Mr. Hartl] (http://michaelhrtl.com) for the back end that runs this program and for his beautiful tutorial [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org) which has taught me everything I know about ruby and rails.
Things I have added/hope to add.

Branding for U 31. Book review modules. A working Admin assignment process. A forum. Recipie area. A mobile version for smart phone users. Password reset function. Private messaging. Search for users. Search for Books. Search for Authors. Hopefully  much more.
